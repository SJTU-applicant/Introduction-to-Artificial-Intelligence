## Course Prerequisites
You should have taken VE281. The course assumes familiarity with basic data structures (e.g., linked-lists, trees, graphs) and the basic operations on them.

## Grading Policy
- **Participation:** 5%
- **Homework:** 15%
- **Projects:** 30%
- **Midterm Exam:** 25%
- **Final Exam:** 25%

Participation includes graded quizzes, attendance, answering polls, ungraded quizzes, activity on Piazza, and online etiquette.

### Graded Assignments
1. **Late Submission Policy:** Assignments lose 20% of their total point values per day turned in late.
2. **Extensions:** Granted exceptionally for documented medical reasons or personal emergencies. Contact the instructor with written proof of the emergency.
3. **Projects:** Developed in Python 3.6, graded automatically for correctness. Slip days can extend deadlines up to a total of 5 slip days across all projects, with a maximum of 2 slip days per project.
4. **Homework:** Both electronic and written components are included. You can drop the lowest 2 written homeworks and the lowest 2 electronic homeworks.

### Exam Policy
- Exams are closed book with no electronic devices allowed. Missing an exam without a medical or personal emergency results in a zero.

## Academic Integrity
1. Attendance in person is expected.
2. Programming assignments must be done individually or with a team member without external help.
3. Homework assignments must be individual work.
4. Exams require individual effort under the JIâ€™s Honor Code.
5. Do not share solutions with other students even after the course ends.
